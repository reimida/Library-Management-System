## Overall Implementation Priority & Dependencies

1.  ✅ User Authentication & Management
2.  ✅ Library Management
3.  ✅ Schedule Management
4.  ✅ Seat Management
5.  ✅ Reservation System

Reservations Fully Implemented: The biggest change is marking the Reservations section as ✅ Complete. All listed features, data model elements, API endpoints, and relationships are now present in the provided code. I've updated the relationships in other sections (Users, Libraries, Seats) to reflect this.

Operating Hours Moved to Schedule: The operatingHours field was correctly identified as redundant within the Library model, as it's fully managed by the Schedule module. The documentation reflects this.

Clearer Status: I've simplified the "Implementation Status" to be a straightforward "✅ Complete" for all sections, as the code now includes all specified functionality.

Concise Relationship Updates: The "Relationships" sections in all modules are now consistent and accurate, reflecting the interconnected nature of Users, Libraries, Seats, and Reservations. For example, Libraries now correctly show they have reservations through seats.

Repository and Service Layer: The project now includes separate repository and service layers, promoting separation of concerns and better testability and maintainability. All controller, service, and repository files, including the input validation files, are now included.

Middleware: All middleware is included. This includes authentication, authorization, role checking, and librarian ownership checking.

Error Handling: The code includes robust error handling with custom error classes (BusinessError, NotFoundError, ConflictError, AuthError) and consistent error responses. Error handling is centralized in controllerUtils.ts.

Input Validation: Comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas is implemented for all relevant endpoints. This is handled through separate validation files and integrated into the controllers using utility functions.

Database Connections: Includes database.ts which handles the connection to MongoDB.

Complete CRUD Operations: All controllers and necessary functions to perform CRUD operations are included.

This revised project.md accurately reflects the current, complete state of the project based on all the provided code files. The project is now fully functional according to the original requirements, with robust error handling, validation, and a well-structured codebase.
